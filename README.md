# Certificate Authority Project
> This course emphasizes applied aspects of Information Security. The students will study a number of topics in a hands-on fashion and carry out experiments in order to better understand the need for secure implementation and configuration of IT systems and to assess the effectivity and impact of security measures. [...]

> The students will also complete an independent project: based on a set of functional requirements, they will design and implement a prototypical IT system. In addition, they will conduct a thorough security analysis and devise appropriate security measures for their systems. Finally, they will carry out a technical and conceptual review of another system. 

The following project description (short version) is taken from the [assignment.pdf](assignment.pdf) file.
Our **system description** together with the **risk analysis** can be found in the [report.pdf](https://github.com/silvanegli/AppliedSecLab16/blob/master/report/report.pdf). In order to setup **our system** 
you can download and import the following [appliance.ova](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14S32s4kC6AibPTYFD3vTlT0YS19Anpza) file into VirtualBox. In the [review.pdf](https://github.com/silvanegli/AppliedSecLab16/blob/master/review/review.pdf) you can find our analysis of the other group's system which can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13Vx4DCPUvofZo4if_ln6FsKDUijt4IkS).
