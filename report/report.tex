\section{System Characterization}

\subsection{System Overview}

20 points

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{systemoverview.pdf}
	\caption{System overview}
	\label{figure:systemoverview}
\end{figure}

Describe the system's mission,  the system boundaries,
and the overall system architecture, including the main subsystems and
their relationships.   This description should provide a high-level
overview of the system, e.g., suitable for managers, that complements
the more technical description that follows.


\subsection{System Functionality}

Describe the system's functions.


\subsection{Security Design}

Describe the system's security design, including key and session management and 
security of data at rest and in transit.


\subsection{Components}

List all system components and their interfaces, subdivided, for example, into
  categories such as platforms, applications, data records, etc. For
  each component, state its relevant properties.

\section{Risk Analysis and Security Measures}

\subsection{Assets}

\subsubsection{Physical assets}

\begin{description}
\item{\textbf{Firewall:}} The firewall is located in a locked and air conditioned room. There is redundant power supply for its server rack.
\item{\textbf{Application server:}} The application server is located in the same server room with redundant power supply, but in a different rack than the firewall.
\item{\textbf{Backup server:}} The backup server is located in the same rack as the application server also equipped with redundant power supply.
\item{\textbf{Internal network:}} The internal network is an Ethernet local area network connecting the above mentioned components. The components are connected using layer 2 switches located in the server room.
\item{\textbf{External network:}} The external network connects the firewall to the internet by Ethernet cable using a router that is also located in the server room.
\end{description}


logical:
- connectivity

software:
- firewall os
- firewall service
- appserver os
- appserver webserver
- appserver application
- appserver ca scripts
- backupserver os
- backupserver duplicity

information:
database
- certificates
- appserver application configuration (webserver, database, django, ca, ssh)
- private keys
- crl
- backupserver application config
- Logs
- Login credentials
- jwt
- archive key
- ca key (intermediate \& root key)


persons:
- user/employee
- ca administrator
- system administrator
- private key holder

intangible:
- user confidence

Describe the relevant assets and their required security
  properties. For example, data objects, access restrictions,
  configurations, etc.

\subsection{Threat Sources}

\begin{description}
\item{\textbf{Nature:}} Environmental factors can hinder the execution of the system. There could be water leaks that would cause damage to servers and lost data.
\item{\textbf{User:}} The employees of iMovie can intentionally misbehave and manipulate the system or unknowingly help an attacker compromise the system.
\item{\textbf{System administrator:}} A system administrator is a more impactful threat source to the system than a user, since a compromised system administrator leads to much bigger security concerns than a compromised user.
\item{\textbf{Script kiddies:}} Script kiddies most likely do not have iMovie as their primary target, but might still try for example to infect the servers with malware to use them in a botnet. They do not have the skills to infiltrate a well protected system and so the usual security measurements and regular updates should be enough to sufficiently protect against them.
\item{\textbf{Skilled hacker:}} A skilled hacker is a big threat source and the usual security measurements most likely do not give enough protection against such an attacker. He might try to infiltrate the ca server and extract private keys to be able to imitate the webserver itself, issue arbitrary certificates or use the keys to perform man-in-the-middle attacks between employees and extract valuable information. He is most likely to be hired by a competitor or a criminal.
\item{\textbf{Malware:}} There is always the possibility of either directed or undirected malware infection if users with infected systems interact with the system.
\item{\textbf{Organized crime:}} Criminals that try to extract information from the system to blackmail people or steal valuable login credentials that are used across multiple systems.
\item{\textbf{Competitors:}} Competitors that want to undermine the reputation of iMovie, gain knowledge about company secrets or simply cause them damage.
\end{description}

\subsection{Risks Definitions}

2 points

Define likelihood, impact and risk level using the following three
  tables.

%\subsubsection{Tools}

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\bf Likelihood} \\
\hline
Likelihood & Description \\
\hline
\hline
High & The threat source is highly motivated and sufficiently capable of exploiting a given vulnerability in order to change the asset’s state. The controls to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited are ineffective.\\
\hline
Medium & The threat source is motivated and capable of exploiting a given vulnerability in order to change the asset’s state, but controls are in place that may impede a successful exploit of the vulnerability. \\
\hline
Low   & The threat source lacks motivation or capabilities to exploit a given vulnerability in order to change the asset’s state. Another possibility that results in a low likelihood is the case where controls are in place that prevent (or at least significantly impede) the vulnerability from being exercised. \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
\hspace{3em}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\bf Impact} \\
\hline
Impact & Description \\
\hline
\hline
High   & The event (1) may result in a highly costly loss of major tangible assets or resources; (2) may significantly violate, harm, or impede an organization’s mission, reputation, or interest; or (3) may result in human death or serious injury. \\
\hline
Medium & The event (1) may result in a costly loss of tangible assets or resources; (2) may violate, harm, or impede an organization’s mission, reputation, or interest, or (3) may result in human injury.\\
\hline
Low & The event (1) may result in a loss of some tangible assets or resources or (2) may noticeably affect an organization’s mission, reputation, or interest.\\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{{\bf Risk Level}} \\
\hline
{{\bf Likelihood}} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{{\bf Impact}} \\ \cline{2-4}
     & Low & Medium & High \\  \hline
 High & Low & Medium & High  \\
\hline
 Medium & Low & Medium & Medium \\
\hline
 Low & Low & Low & Low \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection{Risk Evaluation}

7 points

List all potential threats and the corresponding countermeasures. Estimate the risk based on the information about the threat, the threat sources and the corresponding countermeasure. Adhere to the risk definitions you have given above.


\subsubsection{{\it Evaluation Asset X}}

Evaluate the likelihood, impact and the resulting risk,  \emph{after implementation of the corresponding countermeasures}. For each threat, clearly name the threat source and the the threat action.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{llp{5.5cm}lll}
No. & Threat &  Countermeasure(s) & L & I & Risk \\
\hline
1 & ... & ... & {\it Low} & {\it Low} & {\it Low} \\
\hline
2 & ... & ...& {\it Medium} & {\it High} & {\it Medium} \\
\hline
\end{prettytablex}
\end{footnotesize}



\subsubsection{{\it Evaluation Asset y}}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{llp{5.5cm}lll}
No. & Threat & Countermeasure(s) & L & I & Risk \\
\hline
1 & ... & ... & {\it Low} & {\it Low} & {\it Low} \\
\hline
2 & ... & ...& {\it Medium} & {\it High} & {\it Medium} \\
\hline
\end{prettytablex}
\end{footnotesize}

\subsubsection{Detailed Description of Selected Countermeasures}

Optionally explain the details of the countermeasures mentioned above.



\subsubsection{Risk Acceptance}

List all medium and high risks, according to the evaluation above. For each risk, propose additional countermeasures that could be implemented to further reduce the risks.

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{prettytablex}{p{2cm}X}
No. of threat & Proposed additional countermeasure including expected impact  \\
\hline
... & ... \\
\hline
... & ... \\
